        At Nauth, we follow a simple yet secure process to verify the uniqueness
        of digital artworks. Our system converts your images into binary code,
        which is then compared against a database of existing NFTs. If no match
        is found, your artwork is certified as unique and ready for minting.
        This ensures transparency and protection for artists and collectors
        alike.
